        description : "Welcome back to the OWASP podcast. In this episode, we're headed to The VOID. I speak with Courtney Nash about the Verica Open Incident Database, otherwise known as The VOID, which is a collection of software-related incident reports available at www.thevoid.community.It's a fascinating discussion about how, by gathering data from The VOID, we can make the Internet a safer and more resilient place. Courtney was super passionate about the research work she's doing. It was completely fun to chat with her and they've already produced some very interesting conclusions, in the published report available on The VOID website. I had a blast recording this one and I hope you enjoy it.",

        description : "Hello, it's Matt Tesauro. Welcome back to my take on the OWASP Podcast. It seems as if I'm turning my episodes into the equivalent of a conference hall track, those wonderful interactions you have at conferences, running between rooms at conferences, meeting up with smart minds you don't see all the time. I have the pleasure of reuniting with Wendy Nather, CISO Advisor Extraordinaire, for this episode. We had a very interesting conversation about Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). Like many of my interactions with Wendy, I learned from our conversation. She threw out some really good nuggets. I highly recommend looking up Wendy on Twitter (@wendynather). Besides the security wisdom she's going to drop, she's got a hell of a sense of humor. I think it will be worth the follow.",
